Relevant Column Selection: After reviewing the data, I identified and selected the relevant columns for analysis, focusing on key features like sentiment and airline names.

Sentiment Analysis: I performed sentiment analysis to determine the general mood of the passengers—whether positive, negative, or neutral.

Negative Feedback: One of the most insightful aspects was identifying common negative feedback across the airlines, helping highlight areas where improvement is needed.

Visualization: I created visually appealing graphs using Matplotlib and Seaborn to clearly depict the distribution of sentiments, feedback patterns, and how each airline fares in comparison to others.


📊 Key Findings:

The sentiment distribution showed varying levels of customer satisfaction across different airlines.

I was able to pinpoint common areas of dissatisfaction, enabling airlines to understand what they need to work on.

One airline emerged as the clear winner, garnering the most positive sentiment from passengers.
